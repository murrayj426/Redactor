üìã **PERSONAL AUDIT NOTES FROM YOUR TEAM LEAD**:

What I Really Liked:
I'm particularly impressed with your methodical approach to this incident. Your documentation is exemplary - each update clearly shows what was checked, what was found, and what comes next. The way you handled the RMA process and kept the customer informed shows great professionalism. Your troubleshooting steps were thorough and well-documented with screenshots, which is exactly what we need for our records.

Areas for Growth:
While your overall handling was excellent, I noticed a slight delay in the initial ownership acknowledgment. Consider picking up critical tickets a bit faster - aim for under 15 minutes when possible. Also, while your updates are comprehensive, they could be slightly more concise while maintaining the same level of detail.

My Overall Take:
You've done an outstanding job managing this incident, Kaushal. Your attention to detail and professional communication style really shine through. The way you handled the hardware failure investigation and RMA process demonstrates exactly the kind of thorough, customer-focused approach we want to see. Keep up the great work, and don't hesitate to reach out if you need any support with future incidents.
