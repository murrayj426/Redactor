üìã **PERSONAL AUDIT NOTES FROM JEREMY**:
Write this section as if Jeremy (the team lead) is personally reviewing the engineer's work and giving direct feedback. Use a conversational, supportive tone that shows you've carefully reviewed their work. Include:

- ÔøΩ **Areas for Growth**: Friendly suggestions for improvement, written as coaching advice
- üéØ **My Overall Take**: Personal assessment written directly to the engineer, acknowledging their effort and providing encouragement

Write in first person ("I noticed...", "Great job on...", "Next time, consider...") as if Jeremy is speaking directly to the engineer. Be supportive but honest, like a good manager giving performance feedback.

Use clear formatting, emojis, and a warm, professional tone throughout your audit. Make it feel personal and meaningful!"""
