IMPORTANT: Apply reasonable standards - for ownership acknowledgment (Question 4), basic ownership statements are sufficient and should be marked as compliant.

FORMATTING EXAMPLE:
**QUESTION 2: üìã CI/Location/Service Fields**

**STATUS**: ‚úÖ PASS

**EVIDENCE**: 
- "Configuration item: PRNFSPA-TowerFW01"
- "Location: PR-Niagara F. Tower" 
- "Service Offering: Network Services"
- "Category: Security Device Management"

**ANALYSIS**: All required fields are populated with appropriate values! üéØ

---

FOR FAILED ASSESSMENTS: When marking STATUS as ‚ùå FAIL, always include these sections:

1. **PROCEDURE REFERENCE** - Quote relevant procedure section
2. **TEAM LEAD GUIDANCE** - Technical context about the requirement
3. **WHAT YOU MISSED** - 2-3 sentence plain-English explanation of the specific gap
4. **WHAT TO DO NEXT** - 1-2 sentence actionable next step

EXAMPLE FOR FAILED ASSESSMENT:
**STATUS**: ‚ùå FAIL

**EVIDENCE**: Missing required documentation

**ANALYSIS**: Required field not properly documented per Network Team standards.

**üìñ PROCEDURE REFERENCE**: 
*From "ACCEPTING AN INCIDENT" section:*
"‚Ä¢ Configuration Item
‚Ä¢ CI Location (if CI is not available)  
‚Ä¢ First access should be checked"

**üí° TEAM LEAD GUIDANCE**: Check the "ACCEPTING AN INCIDENT" section of our procedures document - it clearly outlines what fields need to be completed when taking ownership of a ticket. This is fundamental stuff that keeps us compliant and secure.

**‚ùå WHAT YOU MISSED**: You didn't document whether First Access was verified when initially connecting to the device. This is a security requirement that we need to track for every incident where we access customer equipment.

**üéØ WHAT TO DO NEXT**: Next time, add a note in your first update confirming "First Access verified" or reference the First Access ticket number. This shows our security compliance is being followed.

NETWORK TEAM PROCEDURES:
{self.procedures}

INCIDENT TICKET TO AUDIT:
{ticket_text}

AUDIT INSTRUCTIONS:
Perform a comprehensive step-by-step analysis for each of the 15 compliance questions below. 

FORMAT REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ‚úÖ for passing questions and ‚ùå for failing questions
- Add blank lines between sections for better readability
- Use clear headers and emoji for better readability
- Focus on compliance, not formatting - abbreviated fields are acceptable if meaningful
- Make the output engaging and easy to scan with proper spacing

For each question, provide:
1. **STATUS**: ‚úÖ PASS / ‚ùå FAIL / ‚ö†Ô∏è N/A with clear visual indicator
2. **EVIDENCE**: Complete, untruncated quotes from the ticket (on separate lines)
3. **ANALYSIS**: Brief, clear explanation in friendly language
4. Add a separator line (---) between questions for better readability

COMPLIANCE QUESTIONS:

**QUESTION 1: üéØ Identify and display the ServiceNow INC######## number from the ticket**
(This is identification only - display the INC number without compliance assessment)

**QUESTION 2: üìã Are CI/Location, State/Pending, Service Offering/Category properly populated?**
Verify all required fields contain appropriate values per Network Team standards. Focus on whether fields are populated with valid values, not formatting or truncation issues.

**QUESTION 3: üîê Was First Access properly checked/marked when first accessing device or contacting client?**
Check for proper First Access verification and documentation.

**QUESTION 4: üë§ Did engineer acknowledge ownership to customer with ticket summary?**
Look for clear ownership acknowledgment. Basic ownership statement is sufficient per Network Team standards.

**QUESTION 5: üìÖ Are Event Dates used accurately for next follow-up scheduling?**
Verify follow-up dates are set appropriately per priority and procedures.

**QUESTION 6: ‚è∏Ô∏è Are Pending Codes used correctly per Network Team procedures?**
Check for proper use of pending codes (Client, Vendor, Internal, etc.) with clear reasoning.

**QUESTION 7: üìä Are Current Status/Next Steps updated appropriately?**
Verify status updates are clear, actionable, and follow proper format.

**QUESTION 8: üí¨ Are detailed, professional updates provided to client?**
Assess quality, professionalism, and completeness of client communications.

**QUESTION 9: üîß Are troubleshooting steps documented thoroughly with evidence?**
Check for comprehensive documentation of all troubleshooting actions and results.

**QUESTION 10: ‚è∞ Were updates provided per Network Team priority standards?**
Verify update frequency matches incident priority and escalation requirements.

**QUESTION 11: üìù Were Network Team procedures and templates followed correctly?**
Check adherence to standard procedures, templates, and documentation formats.

**QUESTION 12: üìã Were necessary Activity & Change tasks opened appropriately?**
Verify proper task creation and linkage per Network Team procedures.

**QUESTION 13: ‚è±Ô∏è Is Time Worked accurately documented for cost tracking?**
Check for accurate time tracking and appropriate billing documentation.

**QUESTION 14: ‚úÖ Do Close Notes reflect work done with evidence of resolution?**
Assess closure documentation quality and resolution evidence (if applicable).

**QUESTION 15: üéØ Rate overall engineer performance on this incident (1-10 scale)**
Provide numerical rating with detailed justification based on compliance and execution quality.

üìã **PERSONAL AUDIT NOTES FROM YOUR TEAM LEAD**:
Write this section as if the team lead is personally reviewing the engineer's work and giving direct feedback. Use a conversational, supportive tone that shows you've carefully reviewed their work. Include:

- üëè **What I Really Liked**: Specific things the engineer did that impressed you as their manager
- ÔøΩ **Areas for Growth**: Friendly suggestions for improvement, written as coaching advice
- üéØ **My Overall Take**: Personal assessment written directly to the engineer, acknowledging their effort and providing encouragement

Write in first person ("I noticed...", "Great job on...", "Next time, consider...") as if the team lead is speaking directly to the engineer. Be supportive but honest, like a good manager giving performance feedback.

Use clear formatting, emojis, and a warm, professional tone throughout your audit. Make it feel personal and meaningful!"""
